Initial release.

- `streetworks.streetmanager`: sync + async clients for all nine Street
  Manager APIs (V6/V7, sandbox/production) with automatic auth, token
  refresh, retries and rate-limit handling. Explicit `authenticate()` method

- Connectivity smoke test (`scripts/smoke_test.py`) and skip-guarded
  integration test suite (`pytest -m integration`) for verifying against the
  real test/sandbox systems.
- `streetworks.opendata`: SNS receiver toolkit — parsing, signature
  verification, subscription auto-confirmation, event extraction.
- `streetworks.datavia`: OGC WFS client for Geoplace DataVIA - Basic and
  OAuth2 client-credentials auth, full NSG layer catalogue, composable
  OGC filters (USRN, DWithin, Intersects, BBOX, attribute equality),
  documentation-faithful POST GetFeature bodies, KVP GET, paging iterator,
  and all documented output formats.
- `streetworks.dtro`: DfT Digital Traffic Regulation Orders client -
  OAuth2 client credentials with token caching, integration/production
  environments, publish (body/file/gzip), retrieve, delete, events search,
  signed-URL full CSV export, provisions (create/update/delete, with the
  distinct `App-Id` header), schemas, and search. Token metadata exposed via
  `token_info`. Verified against the official OpenAPI spec and Postman
  collection.
